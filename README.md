Custom R scripts written to perform the following analyses:

1) Multinomial modeling of animal presence in each EEZ of the Pacific Ocean and the High Seas on every day of the year.
2) Estimation of confidence intervals.
3) Plot creation (R plots were subsequently edited in Adobe Illustrator to produce plots as presented in the paper).

These will likely not be maintained as dependencies change, but users are free to use and adapt.
